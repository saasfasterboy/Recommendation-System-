Recommender System
Overview
This project develops a recommender system to provide personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and interactions. The system employs various recommendation techniques, including collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid methods, to suggest relevant items (e.g., products, movies, articles) and enhance user experience.

Features
Data Collection: Aggregates user interaction data (e.g., clicks, ratings, purchases).
Preprocessing: Cleans and preprocesses the data, normalizing ratings, handling missing values, and encoding categorical data.
Recommendation Techniques:
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends items based on user-user or item-item similarity.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends items based on item features that match user preferences.
Hybrid Model: Combines collaborative and content-based approaches to improve recommendation accuracy.
Evaluation: Measures the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
User Interface: Allows users to input preferences and receive real-time recommendations.
Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Numpy
Scikit-learn
Surprise (for collaborative filtering)
TensorFlow / Keras (for deep learning models)
Flask / Django (for building the web interface)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)
Dataset
The dataset contains information on:

User preferences and past interactions
Item details and features
Ratings or feedback data Data can be collected from platforms such as MovieLens, Amazon, or other relevant sources.
